Foodie: Responsive Food Delivery UI

Project Overview

This project is the front-end interface for a Food Delivery Service Landing Page (named Foodie). The goal was to build a fully responsive static website using only HTML5 and CSS3, demonstrating core web development concepts like semantic structure and modern layout.

Core Technical Concepts
This project uses foundational web development techniques as required for the course:

Layout Techniques:

Flexbox: Used for aligning items in one dimension, primarily for the Header, Footer, and the Promo Offers section.

CSS Grid: Used for two-dimensional layouts, specifically to create the visual consistency of the Category Grid and the Featured Restaurant cards.

Responsiveness: The site adjusts for smaller screens using media queries to ensure a good experience on mobile devices and tablets.

UI Components: We included the necessary form component, which is the main Search Bar in the Hero section, allowing users to input their location and select a food category.

Key Sections Implemented
The site is built with the following main content blocks:

Header / Nav: Contains the logo, main navigation links, and Login/Sign Up buttons.

Hero Section: The main banner area featuring a Call-to-Action (CTA) and the primary Search Form.

Category Grid: Displays different food types (Pizza, Burgers, etc.) in a grid pattern.

Featured Restaurants: Showcases popular restaurant listings in a card format.

Promo Offers: A banner displaying discounts and deals.

Footer: Contains contact information, social links, and copyright details.
